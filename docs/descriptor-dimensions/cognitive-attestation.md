# Cognitive Attestation — Determinability and Faithful Reduction

> Builds on the **Target Determinability** framework by [@schchit](https://github.com/schchit) (Yuqiang Wang, JEP). [Target Determinability under Partial Causal Observation: A Faithful Reduction Framework](https://zenodo.org/records/19678205) remains @schchit's work; this document uses the determinability criterion to ground the `cognitive_attestation` descriptor in the agent-governance vocabulary.
> Origin: [aaif/project-proposals#14](https://github.com/aaif/project-proposals/issues/14) comments 2026-04-23 and 2026-04-24, where @schchit identified the structural resonance between the Cognitive Attestation envelope and the determinability criterion, and we agreed to land the bridging documentation at the vocabulary layer.

This document is the long-form rationale for the `cognitive_attestation`
descriptor dimension. It explains what makes a cognitive attestation *faithful*
under the determinability criterion, and what the descriptor commits to and
does not commit to.

## How this composes with the existing JEP crosswalk

The vocabulary already includes [`crosswalk/jep.yaml`](../../crosswalk/jep.yaml)
— the Judgment Event Protocol mapping contributed by @schchit on 2026-04-15.
JEP captures the *event-level* judgment record: who decided, when, against
what reference. That is the wire-format layer.

`cognitive_attestation` as a descriptor operates one level deeper. It is
about *what was attested* — the structural claim the signed envelope makes
about the agent's latent reasoning state at the moment of decision. The two
compose; they do not conflict.

| Layer | Artifact | Question |
|------|----------|----------|
| Event | JEP crosswalk + envelope | What event happened, signed by whom, against which reference? |
| Cognitive | `cognitive_attestation` descriptor | What property of the reasoning state does the envelope commit to? |

Both can be present in a single end-to-end fixture. A JEP envelope carries
the event; the `cognitive_attestation` descriptor on that envelope declares
the determinability class of the reasoning fingerprint inside it.

## The determinability criterion

From @schchit's framework, a target fact is *determinable* from an observation
if and only if it is constant on every observation equivalence class. That
is: for any two observations `o1` and `o2` that an observer cannot distinguish
under the chosen observation map, the target fact must take the same value.

Applied to cognitive attestation: the *target fact* is a property of the
agent's latent reasoning state at decision time (for example, "constraint C
was considered before action A was selected"). The *observation* is the
signed attestation envelope. The attestation is faithful when:

> Every signed envelope that hashes to the same canonical bytes commits to
> the same target fact about the latent reasoning state.

This is the determinability criterion stated in protocol terms. Two envelopes
in the same equivalence class (same canonical-bytes hash) must imply the
same target fact, or the attestation is not faithful.

## What `cognitive_attestation` is

A signal that an envelope carries a cryptographically-signed claim about the
agent's reasoning state, specifying:

1. **The reduction map** — what aspect of the latent state is being attested
   (constraints considered, candidate actions evaluated, confidence over
   chosen path, evidence cited).
2. **The faithfulness scope** — what equivalence class of observations the
   attestation covers, and therefore what target facts the envelope
   determines.
3. **The signing party** — who attests to the reduction (the agent itself,
   the gateway, an external observer with model access).
4. **The temporal binding** — whether the attestation was signed before,
   during, or after the attested decision (pre-commit, continuous, or
   post-hoc).

A `cognitive_attestation` signal in a receipt means: the envelope makes a
determinable claim about the cognitive state, the reduction map is named,
and a verifier can check faithfulness by recomputing the reduction over the
attested observation.

## What `cognitive_attestation` is not

- **Not a recording of the full reasoning trace.** Diarization records every
  token; attestation commits to a structured claim. The descriptor covers
  the latter, not the former.
- **Not a guarantee of reasoning soundness.** The attestation commits to
  *what was reasoned about*, not to *whether the reasoning was correct*. A
  faithful attestation of a flawed decision is still a faithful attestation.
- **Not a substitute for `entity_continuity` or `invariant_survival`.** Those
  descriptors cover behavioral drift and boundary-to-boundary continuity
  respectively. `cognitive_attestation` covers the per-decision reasoning
  state, not the cross-session pattern or the cross-boundary survival.
- **Not a privacy-preserving abstraction by default.** A cognitive attestation
  may reveal latent state to verifiers. Privacy preservation (selective
  disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs over the reduction) is a separate concern
  and is not in scope for the descriptor v0.1.

## Composition with adjacent descriptors

`cognitive_attestation` composes naturally with three existing descriptors:

| Adjacent descriptor | Composition |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `delegation_chain` | The attestation may bind to the delegation chain hash, asserting that the reasoning was constrained by a specific authority chain at decision time. |
| `entity_continuity` | A behavioral fingerprint dimension may include attestation-class statistics (rate of faithful vs unfaithful claims), feeding into the PDR slope. |
| `invariant_survival` | An invariant about reasoning may be attested across boundaries — for example, "no decision in this session relied on constraint C" — turning a cognitive property into a survival check. |

These compositions are descriptive; the descriptor v0.1 does not enforce them.
They establish where future fixtures can compose `cognitive_attestation` with
existing structural and behavioral signals.

## Determinability classes (v0.1)

The descriptor v0.1 recognizes four determinability classes for cognitive
attestations, ordered by strength:

| Class | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `precondition_set` | Attestation commits to which preconditions were available at decision time (delegation scope, policy constraints, tool availability, context window). | "At step 3, the agent was operating under delegation D with scope S, with tools T1..Tk available." |
| `candidate_set` | Attestation commits to which candidate actions were evaluated and which were eliminated, with elimination reasons. | "At step 3, the agent considered actions {transfer, deny, escalate}. Transfer eliminated: violates policy 4.2." |
| `decision_path` | Attestation commits to the chosen path with confidence and the structured reasoning that selected it. | "At step 3, the agent chose 'deny' with confidence 0.91, citing constraint compliance." |
| `pre_commit_chain` | Attestation chains pre-commitments emitted *during* reasoning, before the final decision is signed. The final envelope chains all prior pre-commit attestations. | "Before deciding, agent signed: 'about to evaluate three paths.' Then: 'path A fails C.' Then: 'path B passes, 0.87.' Final: 'I choose path B.'" |

Each class corresponds to a different reduction map and a different
faithfulness scope. A signal entry can carry exactly one class per envelope;
multiple envelopes may compose to cover multiple classes across a session.

The four classes are *not* a hierarchy of correctness. They are different
contracts between attestor and verifier. `precondition_set` is the cheapest
to produce and the least informative; `pre_commit_chain` is the most
expensive and the most informative. Choice of class is an integration
decision, not a vocabulary requirement.

## Boundaries

The descriptor v0.1 explicitly does not standardize:

- The reduction map syntax (left to implementers and future work)
- The signing-key class required (the descriptor inherits the receipt's
  `system_attributes.signature_capability`)
- The verifier algorithm for checking faithfulness (separate spec work)
- The privacy posture of the attestation (orthogonal concern)

What v0.1 does standardize: the determinability framing, the four classes,
the composition rules, and the boundaries above.

## Future work

The `pre_commit_chain` class is intentionally lightweight in v0.1. The full
specification of continuous attestation during generation — chained
intermediate commitments emitted as the model reasons, with the final
envelope binding all of them — is a v0.2 item. It depends on tighter
integration with model generation loops than current SDK/model interfaces
support, and the determinability criterion may need extension to handle
streaming observation maps cleanly.

We expect v0.2 to be informed by:
- Operator experience with v0.1 `decision_path` attestations
- Extensions to the Target Determinability framework for streaming
  observations, if @schchit's theoretical work extends in that direction
- Convergence with cognitive-attestation primitives in adjacent ecosystems
  (Anthropic interpretability, frontier-model evaluation suites)
